## <a id="news"></a>📢 News
We are excited to announce that the dataset and code for this project will be made publicly available 
immediately upon the acceptance of the paper. Stay tuned for updates!

## <a id="introduction"></a>💡 Introduction
RS-OmniBench is a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to offer a holistic evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in the context of remote sensing imagery. The benchmark includes seven meta-tasks and 53 subtasks, addressing image-level, region-level, and pixel-level understanding.

With a total of 175K multiple-choice visual questions, RS-OmniBench rigorously evaluates the recognition, localization, and reasoning capabilities of LVLMs in remote sensing imagery.

## <a id="evaluation"></a>📊 Evaluation Results
- An overview of 22 LVLMs evaluated in this study. This table is provided in the **Supplementary Materials** of the paper.

- Quantitative results for 22 LVLMs across seven core meta-tasks 
from three perspectives (image-level, region-level, and pixel-level) 
are summarized. Accuracy is the metric. The overall accuracy score 
is calculated across all data in RS-OmniBench. 
Bold indicates the best performance in each column, 
and underline represents the second best.

- Results of 22 LVLMs across 53 diverse subtasks: Horizontal axis representing subtasks ('IW-' for image-wide, 'RS-' for
region-specific) and vertical axis representing models. 
Current LVLMs exhibit limitations across a wide range of subtasks (blue region).
